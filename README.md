Decentralized File Verification (DFV)
Overview
DFV is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to upload files, generate cryptographic hashes, and store them on the blockchain. This ensures file authenticity and integrity, allowing anyone to verify whether a document has been tampered with.

Features
Upload and hash files for verification.
Store file hashes securely on the Base blockchain.
Verify document integrity by comparing the fileâ€™s hash with the stored blockchain record.
Technologies Used
React.js
Web3.js
Solidity (Smart Contracts)
IPFS (Optional for decentralized storage)
Base Blockchain
Hardhat
